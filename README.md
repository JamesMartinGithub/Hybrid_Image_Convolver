# Hybrid_Image_Convolver
A script that performs convolution on an image with a provided kernel, and a tool that combines two images to create a hybrid image

# Documentation:
- Example usage of the tools can be found in `main.py`
- A side-by-side demonstration of how the hybrid image process works is provided as `Stages.bmp`

`ImageComparerTest.py` is a script that takes two input images and creates a new image with black pixel in places where the pixels from the two inputs differ.
It was used during testing of the convolution and hybrid image tools
